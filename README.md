# VenusHacks2023

<h1> Meals4Me </h1>
Daily meal planner for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks.
Navigating college life is difficult, to say the least. What's even harder is navigating it with an empty stomach. That's why we created Meals4Me. 
Meals4Me helps students, or anyone, with choosing a meal for the day whether you're craving breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack. We hope this will encourages users to stay healthy and well-fed.
