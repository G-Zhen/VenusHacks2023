    <p>Navigating college life is difficult, to say the least. 
      What&#39;s even harder is navigating it with an empty stomach. That&#39;s why we created Meals4Me. 
      Meals4Me helps students, or anyone, with choosing a meal for the day whether you&#39;re craving 
      breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack. We hope this will encourages users to stay healthy and well-fed.</p>
